Hey, hey, clear the way
Looks like this is my lucky day
I'm gonna meet my sweetie now

Just can't be annoyed
Am I happy, I'm overjoyed
I'm gonna meet my sweetie now

Oh, what kissin' and oh, what pettin'
Oh, what lovin' I will soon be gettin'

Yay boy, what a date
Here I go, I can hardly wait
I'm gonna meet my sweetie now

Oh, what kissin' and oh, what pettin'
Oh, what lovin' I will soon be gettin'

Yay boy, what a date
Here I go, I can hardly wait
I'm gonna meet my sweetie
My tootsie, wootsie sweetie
I'm gonna meet my sweetie now
